# Monetization Strategy: The Peach Economy

## Philosophy
Keep entry low to encourage volume, but monetize curiosity ("Ripening"). Pricing is optimized for a student/intern budget in Delta State.

## Pricing Tiers

### 1. The "Student Saver" 🎒
**Target:** Year 1-3 Nursing Students.
**Price:** N500
**Pits:** 20 Pits
**Value:** 4 Ripens (N125 per Ripen)
**Psychology:** Equivalent to a quick snack or recharge card. Low friction.

### 2. The "Intern Bundle" 🩺
**Target:** Interns & Working Nurses (with slightly more disposable income).
**Price:** N1,000
**Pits:** 50 Pits
**Value:** 10 Ripens (N100 per Ripen)
**Psychology:** Best value. Encourages bulk buying. "Buy more, save more."

## Payment Gateways
- **Paystack:** Primary integration. Widely trusted in Nigeria.
- **Flutterwave:** Secondary/Backup.

## "Ripen" Mechanics
- **Cost:** 5 Pits per Ripen.
- **Free Actions:** Matching, Chatting (once ripened by one party? TBD, currently strictly viewing details costs pits).
- **Incentives:** Occasional "Happy Hour" (Ripen for 3 Pits) to drive engagement during low-activity hours.
